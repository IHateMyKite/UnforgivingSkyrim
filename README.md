# UnforgivingSkyrim
Extension to Unforgiving Devices mod by iHateMyKite

Requires DD 5.2Beta10 or newer.
Added Dasha's items. Added their meshes and textures to package. 

Added 3 suits - Cursed, Boxbinder(uses Abadon Dasha's items) and Random(adds random Abadon items).

Currently there is Abadon Shout - complex shout which acts differently depending on who uses is (male or female) and on whom it used (male or female).
Status: working, subtitles made and sounds used are empty ones until I get good ones. Only a thunder when cast at the moment. Good enough for now.
Quest to obtain it is in planning phase.
Added it to draugrs, not working yet...

Known Problems:
Draugrs are not using Abadon Shout despite everything looking like it should work...
Goo Arrows are not working ATM. Trying to figure out why...
