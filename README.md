# UnforgivingSkyrim
Extension to Unforgiving Devices mod by iHateMyKite

Requires DD 5.2Beta10 or newer.
Added Dasha's items. Added their meshes and textures to package. 

Added 3 suits - Cursed, Boxbinder(uses Abadon Dasha's items) and Random(adds random Abadon items).

Currently there is Abadon Shout - complex shout which acts differently depending on who uses is (male or female) and on whom it used (male or female).
Status: working, subtitles made and sounds used are empty ones until I get good ones. Only a thunder when cast at the moment. Good enough for now.
Quest to obtain it will be launched after observing it from draugrs or getting hit with it after completing MQ104 (Dragons Rising).
Added it to draugrs high-levels - bosses and scourges (they have Unrelenting Force normally, now Abadon Shout too), they use it! Yesss! If they have other shouts - they use them randomly too, which is nice.
After using someone (player or follower, doesn't matter) they are happy and will not attack anymore, but will defend themsleves in case of aggression, which I like!

Known Problems:
Goo Arrows are not working ATM. Trying to figure out why...
Current implementation of USWhip function support whipping of player only, maybe rewrite is some time later... For now added checks to not to call it when victim is not player.
