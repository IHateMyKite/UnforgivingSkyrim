# UnforgivingSkyrim
Extension to Unforgiving Devices mod by iHateMyKite

Requires DD 5.2Beta10 or newer.
Added Dasha's items. Maybe will add them to package later. 
For now - enough to have installed Dasha's mod or DCL, without their esp enabled.

Added 3 suits - Cursed, Boxbinder(uses Abadon Dasha's items) and Random(adds random Abadon items).

Currently there is Abadon Shout - complex shout which acts differently depending on who uses is (male or female) and on whom it used (male or female).
Status: working, no subtitles or sounds for it, only a thunder when cast. Maybe good enough for now?
Quest to obtain it is in planning phase.
Added it to draugrs, not working yet, trying to figure out why...

Known Problems:
Goo Arrows are not working ATM. Trying to figure out why...
Abadon Slave Harness without Collar somehow conflicts with chastity belts, need to figure out why.
Abadon Heavy Gag needs to be remade into proper panel gag with removable plug.
